# hip8chip
The skeleton of a Chip-8 emulator. Doesn't feature working graphics yet.
Written in C, supposed to use SDL2 later in the feature when I find more time to finish this. 
Primarly written with the help of [this amazing documentation].

Probably doesn't work on Windows due to not using the <windows.h> library that could handle `sleep()`.
